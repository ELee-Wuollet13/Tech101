      <h3>Fundimentals of code</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding is writing and formatting specific documents such that a computer or web browser can read them and do what they say.</li>
        <li>Different languages exist under the umbrella of 'code' and each is used in some scenarios and not others. For example this program uses Javascript, useful becuase it is supported by every modern mainstream web browser.</li>
        <li>One of the best skills for a new coder is learning how to find answers when you stuck, so for more information check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fyvJcSMrVw">this Lifehacker video.</a></li>
        <li>Networking with others interested in writing code is also an important skill- as with learning any language it easier with a fluent speaker to guide you. In the Portland area try <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cities/us/or/portland/">Meetup</a> for events. </li>

          <li>Having code skills does not negate the need for professionalism. Approach any job in coding as you would any job you really wanted: with a Resume, a collected appearance and respect for all parties involved. </li>
